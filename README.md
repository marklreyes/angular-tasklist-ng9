# To Do App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8. Read my full explanation of this code [here](https://www.marklreyes.com/angular-9-task-app-with-ngrx-drag-drop/).

## Features

Provide sorting by table columns and searching.

Add sorting by multiple columns and persist the sorting on refresh.

Add the ability to drag and drop columns to reorder them using the native [Angular cdk drag and drop](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview).

Add ability to manually resize the columns by dragging with the mouse.

Use Angular, RxJs and NgRx [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/) for state management.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
